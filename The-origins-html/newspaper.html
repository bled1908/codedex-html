    <h1>Family Fare</h1>
    <h2>By Laurel Graeber</h2>
    <h3>Aug. 19, 2005</h3>
    <p>A tall, willowy princess falls in love with a short, rotund prince. But their physical dissimilarities are the least of the ways in which they seem mismatched. Their respective kingdoms, suspicious of each other, are separated by a roiling sea. It is only after a time of mutual bombardment that the adult rulers realize that they as well as their children can make beautiful music together.</p>
    <p>Where the Toons Are All About Tunes And I do mean beautiful music: the princess is a violin from the Land of Symphony; the prince is a saxophone from the Isle of Jazz; and their warring factions trade volleys across the Sea of Discord in "Music Land," an uproarious 1935 Disney short featuring animated, anthropomorphized musical instruments. The royal families' route to the Bridge of Harmony -- and a double wedding -- is just one of the highlights in "'Sillies' and Other Symphonies," a program in "I Love to Singa: Cartoon Musicals" from the Film Society of Lincoln Center.</p>
    <p>"I Love to Singa" (the title is a quotation from a little cartoon owl), through Aug. 31, is a series about all manner of marriages between a composer's score and an animator's sketch -- or computer-generated drawing. Organized by Kent Jones and Greg Ford, the series ranges from "Skeleton Dance" (1928) to "The Triplets of Belleville" (2003).</p>
    <p>In addition to "Music Land," which features a rousing Wagner passage, the 90-minute "Sillies" program includes "Woodland Cafe," in which jazz musicians are jiving grasshoppers; "Bumble Boogie," the bandleader Freddy Martin's interpretation of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumblebee"; and a segment of "Fantasia 2000" that combines Al Hirschfeld's drawing with Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." You could even say there's cartoon noir in "Who Killed Cock Robin?," a jazzy avian murder mystery in which the seductress, Jenny Wren, has a voice like Mae West's. (The arrow-wielding culprit is Cupid.)</p>
    <p>Other programs this weekend are "Iwerks by Design," with Ub Iwerks's animation; "Musical Mice" (Mickey et al.); "Allegro Non Troppo," a 1977 opera-buffa riff on "Fantasia"; and, of course, the 1940 classic "Fantasia" itself. It's all a celebration of animation in which music and movement are completely in tune.</p>
    <p>"'Sillies' and Other Symphonies," today, Sunday and Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.; tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. Other programs for "I Love to Singa": filmlinc.com. All at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600. Tickets: $10; students, $7; children under 12, $5; members, $6; 60+, $5 at weekday matinees.</p>
    <p>Beyond the Asphalt Jungle</p>
    <p>Sharon Seitz has spent the last two years going on camping trips with her two young sons. They have hiked rustic trails, rowed on gentle streams, slept under a blanket of stars and even acquired a few leech souvenirs after plunging into a pond -- all without ever leaving the confines of New York City.</p>
    <p>"We've slept outside in every borough," said Ms. Seitz, who recently published "Big Apple Safari for Families: The Urban Park Rangers' Guide to Nature in New York City" (the Countryman Press). "People think you have to drive to the country to see nature. You don't."</p>
    <p>Ms. Seitz will demonstrate this on Sunday in one of the city's wild havens: the Prospect Park Audubon Center in Brooklyn. Her program will begin with a presentation, including a slide show of all the natural marvels her family has encountered. Then she will lead a 30- to 40-minute nature walk along the Lullwater, the waterway that leads into Prospect Park Lake.</p>
    <p>"Hopefully, we'll see some egrets, herons and ducks, and there should be lots of dragonflies," she said. Cicadas are guaranteed -- Ms. Seitz plans to take her own collection -- and she will discuss the surrounding plants, which will probably include jump seed. "If you run a finger along either side of the stalk, the seeds just fly off, and kids love that," she said.</p>
    <p>She hopes to encourage other urban parents to take a walk on the wild side. Ms. Seitz added, "It's O.K. to say, 'I don't know what that bird or butterfly is, but let's take a picture of it or draw it, and we'll figure it out when we get home."'</p>
    <p>Nature walk and presentation, Sunday at 3:30 p.m. at the Prospect Park Audubon Center (enter the park at Lincoln Road and Ocean Avenue), Brooklyn, (718) 287-3400. Free.</p>
    <p>Good, Clean Fun</p>
    <p>Some children just don't like soap and water. But even those who detest baths are likely to enjoy the sudsy afternoon tomorrow at the Greenburgh Nature Center in Scarsdale, N.Y. The program is called "Bubble Trouble," a bit of a misnomer. There will be neither toil nor trouble (nor any recitations from "Macbeth").</p>
    <p>"We'll make big batches of bubble stuff," said William Lawyer, the center's executive director. "We'll have bubble art, bubble games and bubble magic." The art will consist of blowing bubbles onto wet painted paper for a "Jackson Pollock effect," he said. The games will include contests for the biggest bubble and the longest-lasting one. The magic will involve tricky bubbles.</p>
    <p>"Depending on the age of the children, we'll get into the science of how bubbles are formed," Mr. Lawyer said. "Can you make a square bubble? That's a question we'll explore."</p>
    <p>The bubbles will be outdoors, and families are encouraged to dress appropriately. Think of this as an occasion when you really can just wave a wand and make your children happy.</p>
    <p>"Bubble Trouble," tomorrow at 2 p.m. at the Greenburgh Nature Center, 99 Dromore Road (off Central Avenue), Scarsdale, N.Y., (914)723-3470. Admission: $4; members, $1.</p>
